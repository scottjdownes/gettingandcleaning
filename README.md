Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==================

##Summary of Contents
This repository contains the piece parts of my course project.
* Codebook.md - This file describes the column names and data associated with this effort.
* README.md - That's this file and it describes the project itself.
* run_analysis.R - That's the actual R script used to execute the required steps in the project.

##Assumptions
The run_analysis.R script was executed successfully on a Mac OS X system running
RStudio. Note that the script downloads the full data set from the internet.
The download is moderately large (>60 MB). As such, you may wish to comment out the first line where the zip is downloaded once you've executed the script one time successfully.

##Thanks
Thanks for taking the time to look at my work here. :)
